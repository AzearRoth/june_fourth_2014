I guess the great thing about growing up, is that you only do, sort of?
I'm not 100% on what that means.  But I've made some decisions about 
what it means and where I am going.  I have made a lot of decisions.

First, it's time for me to get stability in my life.  Then I can go
back to having fun.  Second, it's time for me to really be disciplined
about exercise.  Third, it's time to let go of old friends.  Some of them
are gone.  And that's okay.  It's time to stop trying for something I
shouldn't have and won't have.  

The past is past.  And yea, we get to choose.  But we aren't the same.
It means I don't really have anyone now.  And that sucks.  But it's okay.
I'll find it.  It's better to be alone and accept then try to fix everyone elses life.
Because I honestly can't.  At least not now.
